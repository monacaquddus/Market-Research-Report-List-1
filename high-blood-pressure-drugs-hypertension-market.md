<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Blood Pressure Drugs (Hypertension) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ACEI</li><li>CCB</li><li>ARB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high blood pressure drugs market includes several key classes: ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs help relax blood vessels by inhibiting the enzyme that produces angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels. CCBs work by blocking calcium entry into heart and blood vessel cells, reducing contraction and promoting relaxation. ARBs block the action of angiotensin II at its receptor, preventing blood vessel constriction. Each class offers unique benefits and side effects for hypertension management.</p></p>
