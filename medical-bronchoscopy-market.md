<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Bronchoscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Bronchoscopes</li><li>Flexible Bronchoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical bronchoscopy market comprises two primary types: rigid bronchoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. Rigid bronchoscopes are inflexible tubes designed for larger airways, allowing for direct visualization and intervention in conditions like tumors or foreign body removal. They are typically used in surgical settings. In contrast, flexible bronchoscopes are slender, flexible tubes ideal for examining the distal airways and are often utilized for diagnostic purposes, biopsies, and therapeutic interventions. Both types are essential for effective respiratory care.</p></p>
