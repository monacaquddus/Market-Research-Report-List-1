<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mid-end ICU ventilators market is characterized by two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver oxygen directly into the patient’s lungs, providing effective support for severe respiratory conditions. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs masks or similar interfaces to aid breathing without the need for intubation, making it suitable for less critical cases. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure in ICU settings.</p></p>
