<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Drug Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable</li><li>Non-Biodegradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Drug Delivery Systems market comprises two primary types: biodegradable and non-biodegradable systems. Biodegradable systems are designed to be absorbed by the body over time, releasing therapeutic agents while eliminating the need for surgical removal, thereby enhancing patient compliance. Non-biodegradable systems, on the other hand, are made from materials that remain in the body and require eventual extraction. These systems offer prolonged drug release but necessitate follow-up procedures, impacting patient convenience and healthcare costs.</p></p>
